*** Parts used in the diagram

[[./img/parts.png]]

From left to right these parts are:

- 470Î© resistor
- 10kÎ© resistor
- 100nF ceramic capacitor
  + These are not polarized and you can connect them in any way
- 1000uF/6.3V capacitor
  + The short leg is minus. Sometimes there is a minus sign one the negative side as well
- NeoPixel 5mm Through-Hole LED. The legs from left to right represent (the flat side is to the right):
  + Short leg 1: Data in
  + Short leg 2: +5V
  + Long leg 1: Ground
  + Long leg 2: Data out
- A push button

** How to compile

Download the arduino IDE. Install the following libraries (other versions than
the ones given will most probably work as well but I compiled it with these versions):

- Adafruit NeoPixel version 1.1.3
- EnableInterrupt version 0.9.8

To install a library go to =Sketch= -> =Include Library= -> =Manage Libraries...=
